Arduino-Cat-Feeder
==================

An Arduino Project that uses two servos, a Peltier cooler, and a RTC to feed pets

See my YouTube video for a detailed explanation: http://youtu.be/CZ4fDnMezqU

If your wondering why it is not compiling, please note all the required libraries in the program.

Update 5/30/16:
This is a very old version of the project. I created this before I was very good at programming, here is a much better newer version of the project https://github.com/wizard97/KittyFeeder2.
